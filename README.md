# Security-Bot-V2
This is a LEGACY security bot that I made with a minimal splash page containing stats written in JavaScript &amp; ExpressJS.

This is a multipurpose ban database program designed to store users that are naughty and you want to keep out of servers. This was originally created as a commission for a user but now the code is being sold here. (permitted by the ToS agreed to by the user).

# Dependencies
- [VPS (Not Bot-Hosting)](https://stormserverhosting.com/index.php?rp=/store/vps-hostings)
- [Node.JS v16.13.2](https://nodejs.org)
- [MySQL Server](https://docs.hyperz.net/c/knowledgebase/mysql-install)
- Discord Account

This program was written in the package version 13 of Discord.JS. Meaning you will likely need NodeJS Version 16 on your operating system.

`This product includes a public REST API.`
